# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant du the task
- Do not touch code that is not related to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architrecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitely structured
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code change
